pytig-data
============

Data repository for testing installation of [pytig](https://github.com/gryBox/pytig).  The repository only exists for testing the succesful installation and compilation of `pytig`. It includes two datasets:
1.  photosynthesis_raw: Seven labeled images.  Each image only has one caption. And some of them are long.
2.  photosynthesis_lbld: Seven labeled images.  Each image contains a fixed number of captions per image.

Other datasets for text to image generators can be downloaded using `pytig.load_dataset`.
