photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that can later be released to fuel the organisms activities this chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules such as sugars which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water hence the name photosynthesis from the greek ph≈çs light and synthesis putting together in most cases oxygen is also released as a waste product most plants most algae and cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis such organisms are called photoautotrophs photosynthesis is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the earth s atmosphere and supplies all of the organic compounds and most of the energy necessary for life on earth
